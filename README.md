# Fast, Cheap, Good - Pick Two

A simple web app to demonstrate the project management triangle: you can have it fast, cheap, or good - but you can only pick two.

## About

The project management triangle (also known as the "triple constraint" or "iron triangle") is a fundamental concept in project management that illustrates the relationship between three key constraints:

- **Fast**: Quick delivery/turnaround time
- **Cheap**: Low cost/budget
- **Good**: High quality/well-done

The principle states that you can optimize for any two of these, but not all three simultaneously:

- Fast + Cheap = Lower quality
- Fast + Good = Higher cost
- Cheap + Good = Takes more time

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. Try selecting any two options to see the constraint in action - the third option will automatically become unavailable.

## Demo

Try selecting different combinations to see how the project management triangle works in practice!
